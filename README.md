#### Custom Start Bonuses

        - preliminary survey data / full survey data of X(0-100) percent of planets
        - known location of hypershunts

        - X amount of hyperspace terrain data (0 to 700 to unlock the skills)

    - Defect Remnant Start
        - you can pilot ai ships
        - you get automated ship points per player level
        - debuff that makes all ships with crew requirements above 0 have a max cr of 10 and peak combat time of 10 seconds
        - Remnants hate you and send fleets to eliminate the error that was your birth


### WIP



#### Colony Crisis speed modifier (increase or decrease point gain by a factor)
    - maybe scaling considering colony size, but Im not certain if possible


#### Permanent Wars
    - all vanilla factions hate you
    - all non vanilla factions hate you
    - Total War (everyone hates everyone)
    - faction list vs faction list (see faction name help file for how to write the names)


#### Player Reknown 
    Affects only FleetPoints ratings for autoresolve)


#### Notification filter
    so you dont get spammed with "Scan this derelict ship for 30k"


#### Own faction start with more difficulty settings
    - random
    - game journalist: your own system, close to the core, perfect planets, gate, all domain era stable points
    - easy core: your own system, close to the core, nice planets, gate, 3 stable points
    - easy rim: your own system, far from the core, nice planets, gate, 3 stable points
    - medium core: your own system, close to the core, ok planets, 3 stable points
    - medium rim: your own system, far from the core, ok planets, 3 stable points
    - hard core: system with faction that hates you, bad planet, on lost planet you get 1 year to reconquer or you get game over
